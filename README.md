# 3D Tetris Game (Inspired by BLOCKOUT)

This project is a 3D version of the classic Tetris game, inspired by **BLOCKOUT**. The game uses **OpenGL** and **GLFW** for rendering and input handling, and it is developed in **C++**. Players control and rotate tetrominoes within a 3D grid, aiming to fill entire layers without gaps. The game features continuous gameplay where pieces are drawn and controlled using keyboard inputs, with movement and rotation managed by custom algorithms.

## Features
- **3D Grid and Tetrominoes:** Control and rotate tetrominoes in a 3D space, aiming to fill entire layers.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Custom algorithms handle movement and rotation via keyboard inputs.
- **Rendering:** Real-time 3D rendering using **OpenGL**.
- **Sound Integration:** Background music or sound effects using **musicConsole**.
- **Core Development:** The game logic, grid management, and rendering are developed in **C++**.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **GLFW** (for window and input management)
- **OpenGL** (for 3D rendering)
- **musicConsole** (for sound and music)

## Installation & Setup
